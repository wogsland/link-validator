## Set Up

Point your browser to `index.html` and full speed ahead!

## Testing

The tests are run using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), which can be grabbed via

    npm install

assuming [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) is installed on your
machine. If not, then you'll need to grab that first. To run the tests from the
root directory,

    mocha test/test.js
