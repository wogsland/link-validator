    B) Write a front-end single page app (JavaScript + React*)

    NB: Doing this in an AJAX call to a PHP endpoint where a cURL request gets
    the HTML and then parses it for all the links would have been my first
    choice as a solution but fell outside the bounds of the spec.

    The application must include a form with a single input for a valid URL. Submitting
    the form will request the URL, and the application must parse the HTML response,
    generate a list of links contained on the page, and display the list beautifully
    in the UI.

    * We like React, but if you haven’t worked with React before, it’s fine to choose
    another front-end framework.

    If you end up with extra time, feel free to comment on the following in your code:
    How might the application handle poorly formatted HTML?
    Poorly formatted HTML could be parsed directly by searching for "href="
    rather than grabbing the document links.

    If you solved challenge A as well, how might it hook into challenge B, and what
    would the UI look like to display successful and failed validation?
    The Javascript function could just be included on the page and called as
    part of the successful ajax return to process through the links from loaded url.
